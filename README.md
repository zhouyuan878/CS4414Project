CS4414-Project 
=============
Goal: Develop a game engine and a small example game as a demo of the game engine. 

Deliverables: A text-based adventure game developed in Rust that supports multiplayers in real time. Multiple players can connect to the game server and play the game concurrently. The game world is a two-dimensional map where players could interact with different objects in the game world through a set of commands. The game world dynamically updates itself by adding more objects as players' interaction with the game world becomes more frequent.
