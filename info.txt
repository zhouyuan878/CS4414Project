General Info/Concepts:
______________________

The game world is divided into a two dimensional grid, and each object, where an object is a player, or a colored block, occupies one square. A block is the main playing piece of the world, and is a resource which players can trade, utilize, and create, and which, in turn, shapes the world and the players.

When the game begins, the world is initialized to #of players*2, with no blocks. The game tracks interactions, assigning a point of the appropriate color for each interaction, one to the player initiating, and one to the world total. When the world total reaches the makeup for a block, that block is generated in a random unoccupied space on the map, and the total for that color is decremented by the amount used. When the map is >=80% full, it doubles in size along each dimension.


Players have these attributes, all intialized at one:
Health
Attack
Defense
Inventory (size)

Combat- When a player attacks a block or another player, they deal damage equal to their attack divided by their opponent's defense, rounded down. Blocks have a default defense of 3.
